      "The emergence of the SARS-CoV-2 Omicron sublineages resulted in increased \n",

      "METHODS: Three groups of age- and sex-matched healthcare workers (HCW) who \n",
      "received 2 primary doses of BNT162b2 separated by 35-days, 35-42 days or \n",
      ">42-days were enrolled. Vaccine induced antibody titers at 3 weeks, 3 and 6-9 \n",

      "RESULTS: There were 309 age- and sex-matched HCW (mean age 43 [sd 13], 58% \n",
